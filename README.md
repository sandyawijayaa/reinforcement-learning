# reinforcement-learning
Class project from CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, taken in Fall 2022.

This project involves implementing value iteration and Q-learning, resulting in learning agents that should win almost every time. Agents were first tested on Gridworld (from class), then applied to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.
